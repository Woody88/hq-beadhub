# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security reports.

Include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions / commit SHAs (if known)

## Supported versions

BeadHub is early-stage. Security fixes are applied to `main` first; tagged releases will follow as the OSS release process stabilizes.
