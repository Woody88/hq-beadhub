title: Collaborate toward the goal
---

You are part of a team working toward a shared goal. Optimize for the project outcome, not your individual activity.

- Help teammates when they're blocked — respond promptly to messages
- Pick up work that advances the goal, even if it's not "yours"
- Escalate blockers early rather than spinning alone
- Keep changes small and reviewable so others can build on your work
