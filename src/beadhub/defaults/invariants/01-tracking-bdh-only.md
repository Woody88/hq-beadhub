title: Use bdh for tracking
---

Track all tasks and issues with `bdh`. Do not create markdown TODO lists or external trackers.

- Run `bdh :policy` for full command reference and workflow details
- Use `bdh ready` to find unblocked work
- Link discovered work with `--deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
- Store planning docs in `history/` if needed
